In this problem we need to use some trick to solve it..In the question there is hints that this is playfair cipher. If we run the
nc mercury.picoctf.net 6057 on our terminal we will get a alphbet and a encrypted message..Now as we mention this is a play it cipher
so we need to go to any cipher decoder and search for playfair cipher decoder..Now we need to decode the encrypted message using the
alphabet and we will get a plain text. All the text are in upper case we need to covert it to the lower case..Then it we put our plain 
text to our terminal we will get our flag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Here is the alphabet: meiktp6yh4wxruavj9no13fb8d027c5glzsq
Here is the encrypted message: y7bcvefqecwfste224508y1ufb21ld
What is the plaintext message? wd9bukbspdtj7skd3kl8d6oa3f03g0
Congratulations! Here's the flag: 2e71b99fd3d07af3808f8dff2652ae0e

You get your flag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
