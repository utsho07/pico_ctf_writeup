This is a very nice problem..
we have given a picture to find the flag..The flag is hidden in the picture..
we need to use steghide command to extract the hidden data..the command below:

                                                      steghide --extract -sf atbash.jpg
this will create a encrypt.txt file inside the folder.we can open the folder using cat command

                                                        cat encrypted.txt

Here is our encrypted flag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                                                        krxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_92533667}

using online tool we can decrypt it..it is a Atbash Cipher..After decrption we got our flag..The flag is:
                                                        picoCTF{atbash_crack_92533667}
